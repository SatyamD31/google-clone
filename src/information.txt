https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/using_rest -> identify your application
https://cse.google.com/cse/create/new -> sites to search = www.google.com -> search engine = google -> toggle = search the entire web -> get = search engine id

after providing search query, when we press enter, the search term is pushed into data layer. Then on the search page, 
we can pull it using use state values (now we have that search term). Then we use our custom hook; use google search,
pass the query by making a call to the google custom search api and then we return data as object.
